The company was founded in 1987 by Andrew Florance and incorporated in 1998. The idea of the company came about because Mr. Florance, who was a broker at the time, became frustrated with the quality and amount of real estate information that was available; therefore, Mr. Florance came up with the the idea to centralize information by calling all of the brokers and then making all of the information available to subscribers. This allowed for economies of scale to work so that brokers could eliminate the research staffs and obtain more accurate and comprehensive information that would be less expensive. The comparny is funded by public and private investors. The amount of money received is $144 million (Bowman 2015)

#**Business Activities**
---
The company is trying to solve the problem of having a dearth of accurate information regarding commercial real estate transactions. The company's intended users are commercial real estate brokers, appraisers, real estate investment trust and city and county governments. 

#**Landscape**

Costar is located in the domain of real estate. The company is currently using first image technology, a software system that allows a user to input a propety address and then to view detailed information on the property from multiple providers. The company's competitors are Reonomy and REIS.

#**Results**

The business impact of Costar is that commercial real estate transactions are ble to be completed in a more precise and efficient manner. Buyers and sellers are able to find out information on the proeprties that they are buying and selling, appraisers and investors are able to more accurately value property and municipalities are better able to forcast the yearly tax digest.

Some of the key metrics include: the spread betweeb asking and final sales price of a property, the amount of time a proeprty is listed on the market and the number of times a listed property was visted by an agent. 

As a result of acquistions of two of Costar peers, Loopnet and Apartments.Com, Costar is performing very well in comparison to its peers. However, Costar is very dependent on manual labor but is priced as it were a silicon valley company. 

#**Recommendation**

If I were advising Costar, I would suggests that the company offers services that would help appraiser and brokers to be able to operate more efficiently. One of the ways to accomplish his goal would be to use block chain technology. This technology could cut donw on the time used by appraisers and brokers on the research of titles and previous sale information.

This product would benefit the company because it could provide their primary product users with a product that would help them to spend more time selling and appraising property. The results would be increased membership and fees for the company. 

The technology is appropriate for the solution because it targets a profession that is built on quality information that can be provided in a timely manner (Sernovitz 2019).
